# TB_Hybrid_Model
Hybrid model for controlling the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in a Multi-scale environment. Implemented using GAMA PLATFORM

# To execute a .gaml code using the GAMA platform, follow these steps:
1.	Download and Install GAMA: Ensure you have the latest version of the GAMA platform installed on your computer. You can download it from the official GAMA website (https://gama-platform.org).
2.	Open GAMA: Launch the GAMA application.
3.	Create a New Model: Go to the File menu and select New Model. This will create a new .gaml file.
4.	Write or Import Your Code: You can either write your code directly in the GAMA editor or import your existing .gaml file using the Import option in the File menu. The .gaml file in this project is nammed MetaPop_HybridTB.gaml
5.	Set Up Your Experiment: Define the parameters of your experiment in the code, such as the number of agents, environmental settings, etc.
6.	Run the Model: After importing the code, click the Run button in the toolbar to start the simulation. You can also press F11.
7.	Visualize the Results: Watch the results of the simulation in the various visualization tabs offered by GAMA (graphs and/or maps for this project).
8.	Adjust and Iterate: If necessary, adjust the code and rerun the simulation to observe the changes.

# System Requirement for this source code
